# What do we do for dinner?
# Restaurant Recommendation

This's my Final Proyect to the Master of Data Science for KSchool.

I will use the dataset of Kaggle "Restaurant Data with Consumer Ratings"
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings

I don't know how much it will cover or if I will have enough time to cover my expectations. However, I will cover the maximum possible in the period before the presentation and I will continue with this as far as possible.

## The aim of the proyect:
  1. Be abel to do a recommendation of a restaurant based on the Consumer Ratings information.
  2. Add the distance between the restaurant and user to the recommendation.
  3. Try to compensate the restaurant that has few but good reviews.
  
If in the course of the development of the project some other objective occurs to me I will try to add it.

## Instalation:
For this step you only have to clone the git on yout PC and that's all.

## Execute:
This app it's made for only use on terminal.
You hace to go to the dir where the repo is and execute the execute.py
python -W ignore execute.py
That's all, enjoy.
